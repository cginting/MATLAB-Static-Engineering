# MATLAB-Static-Engineering
This project addresses a static model for a soil retaining wall and models important metrics through MATLAB. This was done for a course.

Project 2 Final Report- Engineering analysis and recommendation report. The report documents the problem-solving process and MATLAB solution. This was not completely written by cginting. See the credits at the end for more information.

Project2script: Annotated MATLAB script. This script provides the graphical models and the minimum Young's Modulus for the soil retaining wall discussed in "Project 2 Final Report"
